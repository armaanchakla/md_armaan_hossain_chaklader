Hello,

* As this is a small application, I have used a small mvc pattern which is slighty customized for my needs.
* If you hit "md_armaan_hossain_chaklader/solution/1", you will get the solution for Problem-1. Same for problem 2 & 3. 
* Problem 3 is a input based request, so Content-Type should be "application/json" to request the url. 
* You can request IpV4 & Ipv6 IP addresses in problem 3. More information in code directory.
* As this is a small application, all three solution code is written in "app/controllers/solution.php" directory.

PS: If you need, I have attached the postman collection in root directory for your convenience.

Thank you.
